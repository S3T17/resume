            <p>If you operate on the command line, you will find that there are several commands that you use over and over again. While the makers of many of the most common command utilities have attempted to eliminate extraneous typing by using shortened names (e.g. <code class="shiki-inline" style="background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9">ls</code> instead of <code class="shiki-inline" style="background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9">list</code> and <code class="shiki-inline" style="background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9">cd</code> instead of <code class="shiki-inline" style="background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9">change-directory</code>), however these are not ubiquitous.</p>

   <p>John Kelvie said:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>[To] me the fundamental challenge with existing version control
    systems is the difficulty of merging change sets from multiple
    developers across the same set of code. To me, this issue comes down
    to the diffing/merging functionality provided by the software, and I
    haven&rsquo;t seen or heard of anything that really improves the state of
    the art. How does GIT address this? How does it make it easier to do?
    Are there specific branching and merging tools it provides? Is through
    the use of more atomic commits (which I could see helping to an
    extent, but only so far as it allows for changes to be small enough
    that there is no overlap, thus sidestepping the problem).</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>There are two concepts that you must understand to really take advantage
    of git. The first is the index / staging area. A full description would
    require its own post but for this discussion you can think of it as a
    temporary branch where you put everything before committing it. You can
    diff between it and the last commit, between it and the working
    directory, etc. The second is that a git repo can have (and usually
    does) have multiple branches in the same location on disk.</p>
    
    <p>The idea of
    multiple branches in the same folder, is critical to understand when
    trying to address conflicts. In most version control systems you have
    one checkout for every branch, each in a different location on your
    disk, and while this is an option in git, you can also have multiple
    branches in the same folder, just like the server side of most version
    control systems.</p>
    
    <p>So, we&rsquo;re going to need an example. Let&rsquo;s assume I&rsquo;ve
    got a git repo with foo.rb. <strong>In the master branch</strong> foo.rb looks like
    this:</p>
    
    <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">if (value == &quot;test&quot;) puts &quot;I'm in!&quot;
    end
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>On <strong>branch_one</strong> we&rsquo;ll change that test to</p>
    
    <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">if (value == TEST\_CONSTANT) 
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>and on <strong>branch_two</strong> we&rsquo;ll make it</p>
    
    <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">if (value ==&quot;test&quot; || value == &quot;test2&quot;)
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>Now, if master, branch_one,
    and branch_two are all in the same repo we could stay in the same
    directory and &ldquo;checkout&rdquo; whichever branch we wanted to be working on.
    All the would change in place without you ever leaving the directory.
    So, if you checkout master and cat foo.rb you&rsquo;ll get the first example.
    Checkout branch_two and cat foo.rb (without changing directories) and
    you&rsquo;ll see the last example. I&rsquo;m sorry if that was obvious, but it&rsquo;s
    critical that you understand that, and some newbs just aren&rsquo;t aware of
    it yet.</p>
    
    <p>So, back to John&rsquo;s questions. How does git make branching and
    merging easier to do, and does it provide any specific tools for
    managing it? Well, first off the commands are freaking simple:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>to create a branch in the same repo git branch branch_name or, more
    commonly git checkout -b branch_name The latter creates the branch
    then checks it out so you can immediately start working on it.</li>
    <li>to merge in a branch in the same repo git merge branch_name</li>
    <li>to merge in a branch from a remote repo you&rsquo;ve got git fetch and git
    pull More on these two in a minute, because they do dramatically
    change how you manage conflicts.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>As for specific tools for managing it. Yes and no. &ldquo;&hellip;if you rather use
    GUI tools to merge files instead of editing file with conflict markers
    (like shown in example), you can use git-mergetool, which would call GUI
    tool of your choice; currently supported out of the box are: kdiff3,
    tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, and opendiff.&rdquo;
    BUT, regardless of GUI tools, the ability to have multiple branches in
    the same local repo changes everything.</p>
    
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example. Same files as
    above, except I&rsquo;m using a different repo for each instead of different
    branches in the same repo, because that&rsquo;s the way it would be when
    pulling from other people, and since we&rsquo;re dealing with people, we&rsquo;ll
    say branch_one is Mary&rsquo;s branch and branch_two is Bob&rsquo;s (pretend that
    the. The first thing you&rsquo;d do if you were pulling from these guys
    regularly is to add them to your repos list of remote directories</p>
    
    <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF"><code>$ git remote add marys\_branch ../branch\_one/
    $ git remote add bobs\_branch ../branch\_two/ 
    $ git remote show bobs\_branch marys\_branch
    </code></pre>
    <p>And here&rsquo;s where the difference
        between pull and fetch come in to play. fetch tells git &ldquo;hey, go get
        this remote data, and shove it into a &ldquo;remote&rdquo; branch <em>in my repo</em>. pull
        says, &ldquo;fetch it, and <em>also</em> merge it with my current branch.&rdquo; Using
        fetch we can suck in data from two sources, knowing full well it would
        conflict if we tried to merge it, but still have no problems.</p>
        
        <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">$ git remote update
        Updating marys_branch
        remote: Counting objects: 5, done.

        if (value == &quot;test&quot;)
        puts &quot;I'm in!&quot;
        end
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>So, now, we&rsquo;ve pulled in two people&rsquo;s
        conflicting changes, but not applied either. So, lets assume I don&rsquo;t
        suspect a conflict (hopefully they&rsquo;re not normal occourrances for you).</p>
        
        <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">$ git merge marys_branch/master

        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Damn, a conflict! Who would have guessed? Now, I do
        what git suggests, fix the problem and commit it, but I&rsquo;m neither the
        one who broke it nor the one who knows most about it. So, I&rsquo;m going to
        kick this back to Bob or Mary, but, I may want to see what&rsquo;s going on,
        to help choose who to kick this to.</p>
        
        <p>One thing I can do is see
        specifically which commits are conflicting:</p>

        <p>If the commit messages aren&rsquo;t enough info I can
        actually diff the two branches that conflicted totally separately from
        anything in MY branch.</p>
        
        <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">$ git diff marys_branch/master bobs_branch/master

        <p>I could have also diffed the specific
        commits in conflict if I&rsquo;d wanted, instead of the entire branches. In
        this case it would give the same result. But, not knowing what
        TEST_CONSTANT is (maybe it&rsquo;s a closure, maybe it&rsquo;s a predefined
        variable) I can either make an educated guess that whatever
        TEST_CONSTANT is it&rsquo;s probably a better choice from a maintenance
        perspective and tell Bob to go fix his stuff. Or, I could just send an
        e-mail to both of them and let them figure it out.</p>
        
        <p>It&rsquo;s also important
        to point out that the &ldquo;index in git contains on conflict *all*
        versions of a file: &lsquo;ours&rsquo; i.e. the version in the branch you merge
        into, &lsquo;theirs&rsquo; i.e. the version in the branch you are merging, and
        &lsquo;base&rsquo; i.e. the version in the common ancestor ot the branches, and also
        version with conflict markers.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Another option is to just fix it myself.
        The conflicting file currently looks like this:</p>
        
        <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:foo.rb
        
        if (value == TEST_CONSTANT)
        =======
        if (value == &quot;test&quot; || value == &quot;test2&quot;)
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bobs_branch/master:foo.rb
        puts &quot;I'm in!&quot;
        end 
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>HEAD is git
        slang for &ldquo;the branch you&rsquo;re currently working on&rdquo; which, in this case,
        has Mary&rsquo;s changes successfully merged in (actually, by default it&rsquo;s
        pointing to the last commit on the current branch). So, I decide that
        all three tests need to be there and make the edit, and then update the
        index. You need to update the index because git has already added Bob&rsquo;s
        changes to the index but knows that there was a conflict that needs
        resolving.</p>
        
        <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">$ git status
        foo.rb: needs merge
        # On branch master
        # Changed but not updated:
        # (use &quot;git add ...&quot; to update what will be committed)
        #
        # unmerged: foo.rb
        #
        no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Updating the index is simply a matter of getting the file how you want
        it and saying:</p>
        
        <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">&gt; $ git add foo.rb
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>at which point committing would get you a commit message template that
        started like this:</p>
        
        <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">&gt; Merge commit 'bobs\_branch/master' Conflicts: foo.rb \# \# It looks
        &gt; like you may be committing a MERGE. \# If this is not correct, please
        &gt; remove the file \# /Users/krhodes/temp/trunk/.git/MERGE\_HEAD \# and
        &gt; try again. \#
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>The basic take-away from all this fetch / pull stuff is that it&rsquo;s
        generally a good idea to fetch first when dealing with other people&rsquo;s
        work, because having a local copy of their branch in your repo gives you
        a number of additional options if things go wrong.</p>
        
        <p>And yes, atomic
        commits go a huge way towards avoiding the problem of conflicts, and
        handling them when they crop up. Obviously this applies to centralized
        systems too. They avoid them by keeping your commits on topic. If one
        commit is for bug X you generally don&rsquo;t have to worry about it
        conflicting with a commit for bug Y. And, when you discover that two
        people you&rsquo;re pulling from both have patches for bug X that conflict you
        have many more options.</p>
        
        <p>Another key technique for avoiding conflicts is
        to merge constantly. Every single day you should be pulling any work
        that&rsquo;s been committed upstream. That way, when things do conflict, you
        only have to resolve a little tiny thing (if the commits are atomic then
        it&rsquo;s even tinier), and, if you choose to kick the issue back to someone
        else it&rsquo;s still fresh in their heads. This, of course, applies to
        centralized systems to.</p>
        
        <p>Another way that git (and every other
        distributed system) helps to avoid conflicts is a social change that
        comes out of the distributed nature of the repos. Because you&rsquo;re
        constantly pulling in from multiple sources, having atomic commits
        becomes a requirement to participation. If Bob is a twit and only makes
        massive sprawling commits you&rsquo;re simply not going to pull from him. It&rsquo;s
        not like a centralized system where you&rsquo;re forced to take all the
        changes out there. Whoever is in charge of the main trunk would be
        stupid to accept Bob&rsquo;s changes because if there was a problem in one of
        them it&rsquo;d be a pain in the butt to extract the bits that fixed bug A
        from the bits that didn&rsquo;t really fix bug B. No, they&rsquo;d kick it back to
        Bob, telling him to clean up his stuff and make two separate patches.</p>
        
        <p>This becomes even more important when you&rsquo;re working on a project that
        manages patches via e-mail. Just check out the git mailing list.
        People&rsquo;s patches are incredibly focused, enabling other git developers
        to take just the bits and pieces they choose. Because the patches are
        uniquely identifiable in git, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if some people take a
        change and some don&rsquo;t and you, as the maintainer, pull from all of them.
        Git won&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re two different but identical changes. It&rsquo;ll know,
        &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s change x. I&rsquo;ve got that already.&rdquo; Git also doesn&rsquo;t care how
        a patch got there. It could be from a commit you pulled over the lan, or
        something someone e-mailed. Because it&rsquo;s guaranteed cryptographically
        unique, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
        
        <p>[Update 2] Some additional tips f#        Narebski</p>
        
        <p>If you want to see what some file looks like on other branch
        (or for example at specified point of time, for example at tagged
        revision, marking some released version), you don’t need to use “git
        checkout ‘branch’ &amp;&amp; cat ‘file’”; you can use “git show ‘branch’:&lsquo;file’”
        (see “Examples” section in git-show(1) manpage, and “Specifying
        revisions” section in git-rev-parse(1) manpage).</p>
        
        <p>Below there is example
        how index looks like during conflicted merge. The example uses yet
        another way of specifying object names, i.e. “:’stage’:&lsquo;file’” (we could
        alternatively use SHA-1 or shortened SHA-1 of object shown in
        git-ls-files output, e.g. “git show 2f096cc”).</p>
        
        <pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1f1f1f"><span style="color: #79B8FF">$ git ls-files –abbrev –unmerged
        100644 2f096cc 1 foo.rb
        100644 89f36fe 2 foo.rb
        100644 d3ea75d 3 foo.rb
        $ git show :1:foo.rb
        if (value == “test”)
        puts “I’m in!”
        end
        $ git show :2:foo.rb
        if (value == TEST_CONSTANT)
        puts “I’m in!”
        end
        $ git show :3:foo.rb
        if (value == “test” || value == “test2″)
        puts “I’m in!”
        end 
        </code></span></pre>
        
        <p><strong>Try it yourself!</strong><br />
        I find that reading how to do things like this is much enhanced by actually
        having something to test it on, especially when there are so many
        variables. So, I&rsquo;ve uploaded <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mobtvse_masukomi/assets/2008/07/temp.tgz" title="a temp dir with the three repos">the temp dir with the three
        repos</a>
        I used in writing this. If you go into the trunk repo you&rsquo;ll see that
        the other ones have already been configured as remote repos. And, if you
        go into branch_one or branch_two you&rsquo;ll see that they&rsquo;re clones of
        trunk and thus both already know that their upstream is trunk and how to
        fetch from it without having to configure anything. You can also see
        what the difference would be in pulling and fetching from one of them.</p>
        
        <p>Please let me know if there&rsquo;s still something that&rsquo;s a little unclear
        about dealing with conflicts in git and I&rsquo;ll add it in.</p>
